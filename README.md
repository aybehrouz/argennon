### Argennon: A Scalable Cloud Based Smart Contract Platform Using Argument of Knowledge Systems

Argennon is a next generation cloud based blockchain and smart
contract platform. The Argennon blockchain uses
a hybrid proof of stake (HPoS) consensus protocol, which is capable of combining the benefits of
a centralized and a decentralized system. In Argennon, ledger storage and transaction processing are
outsourced to the cloud and normal personal computers or smartphones, with limited hardware
capabilities, are able to validate transactions and actively
participate in the Argennon consensus protocol. This property makes Argennon a truly decentralized and
democratic blockchain and one of the most secure existing platforms.

The Argennon cloud is trustless and publicly verifiable. Computational Integrity (CI) is
achieved by using succinct argument of knowledge systems (STARK/SNARK)
and data integrity is guaranteed by cryptographic accumulators.

The Argennon protocol strongly incentivizes the formation of a permission-less network of Publicly Verifiable
Cloud (PVC) servers. A PVC server in Argennon, is a conventional data server which uses its computational and
storage resources to help the Argennon network process transactions.
