The most common use for blockchains is in financial applications. This gives a crucial importance to the
security of the consensus protocol used in a blockchain. Unfortunately, many currently used blockchains are
vulnerable to a certain type of consensus attack, known as the bribery attack. In a bribery attack, an adversary
tries to corrupt participants of a protocol by offering them money and making them violate the protocol.

At the time of writing of this document,
the total mining reward for a bitcoin block is around \$150,000. If we assume, in decision theoretic terminology,
that the mining reward accurately defines the utility function of a bitcoin miner, one could hire all hashing power
of the bitcoin network for one hour by
spending only \$750,000. The situation is not much different for PoS blockchains, as long as the total
stake of the validator set is a relatively small value. Here by
stake, we mean a real number measuring the total interest of a user in the system. We are not referring, in
particular, to some locked amount of a user's money that is known as stake in some PoS protocols.

This problem is more severe in blockchains that use randomly selected small sets of validators. These small sets
usually have low total stake and could be easily bribed and corrupted. Selecting these random sets
by hidden random procedures would not help, since the validator himself knows he has been selected, before casting
his vote.

It appears that the only solution to this important vulnerability is to effectively participate all the stakeholders
of the system in the consensus protocol. This large participation makes the protocol resilient against bribery or
collusion because the adversary would need to spend unrealistic amounts of money to bribe enough users.

However, for effective participation in the consensus protocol, a validator needs to be able to detect
illegal transactions. Detecting illegal transactions can be done by accessing the ledger
state and executing transactions according to the protocol rules. The
ledger state, even for small blockchains, could be several
hundreds of gigabytes, and executing transactions could easily become costly when a blockchain is acting as a
smart contract platform. This computational and storage overhead, in practice, could prevent most of
ordinary users from any type of participation in the process of securing a blockchain.

Although a fully decentralized blockchain based on the participation of every user looks appealing, it is not as perfect
as it might seem. The consensus protocol of a blockchain relies on a network of computers, not humans. Ordinary users
use simple and similar computer systems. That means, they all have similar vulnerabilities and weaknesses which could be
used by an adversary to catastrophically attack the consensus protocol. For instance, if a malware, probably using a
common zero-day
vulnerability, has the ability to infect a large portion of normal personal computers, it could be used by an
adversary to control the majority of participants in the consensus protocol and compromise the security of the
blockchain.

Securing a computer system against cyberattacks needs planning ahead and access to engineering resources.
Special software and hardware, like custom-built operating systems and isolated specialized hardware is required.
This is not something a normal user can afford. Only powerful centralized entities having large financial and
technical resources, could build
systems that are resilient against sophisticated cyberattacks. In this regard, we have to admit, a centralized system is
arguably superior to a decentralized\footnote{Note that decentralized and distributed are two different concepts.}
system.

To overcome these difficulties, Argennon\footnote{The classical pronunciation should be used:\textipa{/Ar"gen.non/}}
uses a Hybrid Proof of Stake consensus protocol, which is
capable of combining the benefits of a centralized and a decentralized system. A small committee of
delegates is democratically elected by users via the Argennon Decentralized Autonomous Governance system
(ADAGs). This committee usually\footnote{The election term and the number of committee members can be changed by the
ADAGs.} is elected for a one-year term, has five members, and is responsible for minting new
blocks of the Argennon blockchain.
Each minted block is required to get approved by its corresponding validator committee. Validator committees are very
large sets of validators including at least three percent of the maximum possible stake of the system. A block is
approved if it takes approval votes from at least \(2/3\) of the total stake of its validator committee.

Every block of the Argennon blockchain needs a certificate from both the committee of delegates and
the committee of validators. A block is considered final after its \textbf{next} block gets \textbf{both} of
its certificates. The Argennon protocol ensures that as long as more than half of the total stake of validators is
controlled by honest users, the probability of discarding a final block is near zero even if all the delegates are
malicious.

Centralized block generation brings some interesting features to the Argennon platform, such as flexible and lower
fees, off chain fee payment, optimistic instant transaction confirmation, and runoff protection.
However, it also increases the possibility of transaction censorship. In Argennon, this problem is addressed by a
special High Priority Request (HPR) protocol.

Each block of the Argennon blockchain contains a set of Computational Integrity (CI) statements and a commitment to
the final ledger state of the block. The CI set defines how the final ledger state of the block can be reached from
the state of its previous block via a set of intermediate states.
Each individual CI statement defines an ordered list of external requests\footnote{External requests in Argennon are
similar to transactions in older blockchains.} and determines the state before and after executing those requests:
\[
    \tau_{(s_i,s_{i+1},\mathbb{R})} \coloneqq \text{``$s_{i+1}$ is the next state after executing external requests
        $\mathbb{R}$ on state $s_i$''}
\]
Validators can\footnote{Using the Argennon cloud is optional for a validator.} receive succinct cryptographic proofs
of these CI statements (STARK/SNARK) from the Argennon cloud. They can also receive the state of the previous
block (the required part of it) and proofs that show the received data is consistent with the previous block commitment.

Verifying a succinct proof can be exponentially faster than replaying the computation. Moreover, verifications of
different CI statements are independent of each other and can be done in parallel. As a result, a validator can use
multiple cores for verifying CI statements of a \textbf{single} block and different validator committees can
simultaneously and
independently verify \textbf{different} blocks.
In addition, proof generation of different CI statements similarly can be done in parallel. However, for parallel
proof generation, the state transition needs to be known in advance. That's why in Argennon, delegates do not try
to generate proofs and focus all their computational power on executing external requests and
generating the state transition as fast as possible.

Argennon applications (i.e smart contracts) are stored in a high level text based language on the blockchain. This
language is intended for preserving the
high level information of the application logic to facilitate platform specific compiler optimization at a host
machine. This enables delegates to compile and optimize Argennon applications for their specific hardware platforms
and execute applications efficiently, ensuring the state transition can be found as fast as possible.

Independence of CI statements is useful, but is not enough for having a truly scalable blockchain. To increase
parallelism, the Argennon protocol enforces all external requests to pre-declare their memory access locations. That
would enable a block proposer\footnote{In Argennon, delegates are the only block proposers.} to use Data Dependency
Analysis\footnote{See Section~\ref{sec:concurrency}} (DDA) to indicate independent sets of external requests (i.e.\
transactions) and use those sets for parallel processing. More importantly, these sets can be used for generating CI
statements that are defined on the \textbf{same initial state} and their proof can be generated independently without
the need to calculate the state transition in advance.

The Argennon protocol strongly incentivizes the formation of a \textbf{permission-less} network of Publicly Verifiable
Cloud (PVC) servers. To do so, the Argennon protocol conducts repetitive automatic lotteries between PVC servers.
A PVC server can increase its chance of winning by (i) generating proofs for more CI statements, (ii) providing the
state data to more validators and, (iii) storing all parts of the state instead of more frequently used parts.

A PVC server in Argennon, is a conventional data server which uses its computational and
storage resources to help the Argennon network process transactions. This encourages the development
of conventional networking, storage and compute hardware, which can benefit all areas of information technology.
This contrasts with the approach of some older blockchains that incentivized the development of a totally
useless technology of hash calculation.
